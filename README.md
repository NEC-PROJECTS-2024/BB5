### INTRODUCTION
The restaurant industry has grown to be one of the most powerful sectors with the emergence of several restaurants, dine-out options, and meal delivery apps. The abundance of dining options compels customers to explore a wide variety of cuisines. Bengaluru, recognized as a hub of global culture, mirrors this trend within its vibrant restaurant industry.With more than 12,000 restaurants, Bangalore is known as the foodie's paradise.Due to intense industry competition, restaurants are required to offer not just high-quality food but also a variety of innovative options within their current menu.
Consumers' dining-out habits have changed significantly in India during the last ten or so years.By employing machine learning to identify trends in data and comprehend consumerbehavior, the restaurant industry is expanding its possibilities and raising the bar on service quality.Machine learning  offers  a forecast  for  the elements influencing   the  business based on historical data[14].Because machine learning techniques are so effective at managing huge datasets with inconsistent properties and noisy data, they are often used in conjunction with predictive analytics.
Predictive analytics encompasses a diverse array of statistical techniques aimed at estimating or foreseeing future outcomes. These methodologies utilize statistical methods to anticipate various scenarios and trends..In this work, predictive analytics is performed by regression[8].This work uses the following algorithms Bayesian Regression, Random Forest Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, KNN Regressor, SVM Regressor, Extra Tree Regressor, and Elastic Net Regressor are among the regression methods under consideration.
